Mission Plan Document, D. Seal, 2003. [JPLD-5564]

The Cassini spacecraft, including the Huygens Probe, was launched on 15 
October 1997 using a Titan IV/B launch vehicle with Solid Rocket Motor 
Upgrade (SRMU) strap-ons and a Centaur upper stage.  The spacecraft used a 
6.7-year Venus-Venus-Earth-Jupiter Gravity Assist (VVEJGA) trajectory to 
Saturn, during which cruise observations were conducted to check out, 
calibrate, and maintain the instruments as well as to perform limited 
science.  After Saturn Orbit Insertion (SOI) (1 July 2004), the Huygens 
Probe separated and, on the third encounter with Titan, entered the 
satellite's atmosphere to make in situ measurements during an approximately 
150 minute descent (14 January 2005).  The Orbiter continued a tour of the 
Saturn system until mid-2008 collecting data on the planet and its 
satellites, rings, and environment.

The Cassini Orbiter (CO) was a three-axis stabilized spacecraft equipped 
with one high gain antenna (HGA) and two low gain antennas (LGAs), three 
Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) for power, main engines, 
attitude thrusters, and reaction wheels.  It carried twelve orbiter 
instruments designed to carry out 27 diverse science investigations.  The 
Huygens Probe (HP) was equipped with six instruments designed to study the 
atmosphere and surface of Titan.  It entered the upper atmosphere protected

by a heat shield, then deployed parachutes to descend slowly to the surface
from an altitude of about 200 km.  The instruments, with acronym and 
Principal Investigator (PI) or Team Leader (TL), are summarized below:

    Mission Phases
    ==============     

LAUNCH 1997-10-15 to 1997-10-17
       1997-288   to 1997-290
------

Cassini successfully lifted-off from the Cape Canaveral Air Station complex 
40 on 15 October 1997 at 08:55 UTC. The solid rocket motors burned from 
liftoff to separation at 2 min 23 sec at an altitude of 68,300 m. Stage 1 
ignition began at 2 min 11 sec at an altitude of 58,500 m, and Stage 2 
ignition (and Stage 1 separation) occurred at 5 min 23 sec after liftoff at 
167,300 m. During the first three minutes and 27 seconds of flight, the 
payload fairing shrouded the spacecraft, protecting it from direct solar 
illumination.

The Centaur upper stage separated from the launch vehicle at 9 min 13 sec 
at 206,700 m. The first Centaur burn began at 9 min 13 sec and lasted 
approximately two minutes. This burn placed the Cassini spacecraft into an 
elliptical, 170 km by 445 km parking orbit with an inclination of about 30 
degrees. After 17 minutes in the parking orbit, the Centaur fired again and 
launched Cassini toward Venus en route to Saturn. The injection C3 was 16.6 
km^2/s^2.

Immediately after separation from the Centaur (date?), the spacecraft's 
Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS) pointed the HGA toward 
the Sun to achieve a thermally safe attitude in which the HGA served as an 
umbrella for the remainder of the spacecraft. X-band uplink and downlink 
was established through the LGAs, the Radio and Plasma Wave Science (RPWS) 
Langmuir Probe was deployed, instrument replacement heaters and main engine 
oxidizer valve heaters were turned on, and the Stellar Reference Unit 
(SRU), Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS), and Visible and Infrared Mapping 
Spectrometer (VIMS) decontaminations were started.

TCM 1  1997-10-18 to 1997-11-14
       1997-291   to 1997-318
-----

The Trajectory Correction Maneuver 1 (TCM 1) phase comprised four one-week 
sequences. During most of the TCM 1 phase, the spacecraft was in a 
relatively quiescent state with the HGA pointed toward the Sun. Telemetry 
downlinked by the spacecraft was utilized to make an initial 
characterization of the spacecraft and to assess whether its various 
subsystems survived the launch. Deployment, decontamination, tank heating, 
and AACS checkout activities were started. 

Before the maneuver itself, the fuel and oxidizer tanks were heated in 
order to avoid an irreversible overpressure in the propellant lines.  If 
the tanks fully pressurized before the spacecraft passed through the peak 
temperature regime, then (when the spacecraft did enter the maximum thermal 
environment) the tank pressure would climb without there being a way to 
bring it back down, possibly causing an overpressure. 

TCM 1 was an Earth injection clean-up maneuver placed at 25 days after 
launch. TCM 1 was executed using the main engine with a delta-V magnitude 
of 2.8 m/s. The burn sequence included holding the spacecraft off-Sun after 
burn completion to allow the spacecraft heating to be characterized in a 
relatively benign environment.

INTERPLANETARY CRUISE     1997-11-14 to 1999-11-07
                          1997-318   to 1999-311
---------------------

The Interplanetary Cruise Phase extended from 14 November 1997 to 7 
November 1999.  It consisted of three subphases:  Venus 1 Cruise, 
Instrument Checkout 1, and Venus 2 - Earth Cruise. During most of this 
phase, Cassini's proximity to the Sun constrained the spacecraft to remain 
Sun-pointed, and communications were conducted using the Low Gain Antennas. 
The downlink capability of the LGAs at large spacecraft-Earth ranges was 
very limited.  Between 30 and 150 days after launch, for example, the 
downlink data rate decreased from 948 to 20 bps. 

Beginning on 28 December 1998, the spacecraft approached opposition and the 
HGA could be pointed towards Earth for a period of 25 days while the Probe 
equipment temperature remained within the required range. This provided a 
high data rate window during which checkout activities could be 
accomplished.

      VENUS 1 CRUISE      1997-11-14 to 1998-09-13
                          1997-318   to 1998-256
      --------------

The Venus 1 Cruise subphase started on 14 November 1997 and continued 
through 13 September 1998. The subphase encompassed sequences C5 through C9 
and included two TCMs, one planetary swingby, and three switches between 
LGA1 and LGA2. Most of the period was dedicated to engineering and 
instrument maintenance activities. 

         VENUS 1 ENCOUNTER   1998-04-26
                             1998-116

The first Venus encounter occurred on 26 April 1998.  The spacecraft 
approached Venus from a sunward direction, and closest approach occurred 
just after the spacecraft entered the Sun's shadow for a period of about 15 
minutes. At closest approach, the altitude was 284 km, with a velocity 
relative to Venus of 11.8 km/s. The spacecraft was occulted from Earth for 
about 2 hours. The Earth occultation zone started about 15 minutes after 
the spacecraft left the Sun occultation zone. Accuracy for the Venus flyby 
was assured by using two TCMs (Trajectory Correction Maneuvers), 60 and 20 
days before closest approach, and a clean-up maneuver 20 days after the 
flyby.

     INSTRUMENT CHECKOUT 1    1998-09-14 to 1999-03-14
                              1998-257   to 1999-073
     ---------------------

The Instrument Checkout 1 subphase (ICO-1) started on 14 September 1998, 
continued through 14 March 1999, and consisted of sequences C10-C13. This 
subphase was characterized by the opposition that occurred on 9 January 
1999, which allowed use of the HGA for downlink since the Earth and Sun 
were nearly aligned as seen from Cassini.

All instruments scheduled checkout activities within the 25 day period 
centered on opposition. This was the first opportunity since launch to 
exercise and check the status of most instruments outside of routine 
maintenance. The 'Quiet Test', for example, allowed each instrument to 
monitor other instruments as they turned on and off and provided valuable 
insight into how to integrate science observations during the Saturn tour.

During instrument checkout activities, the spacecraft autonomously went 
into a safe state. Accumulating star position errors from the slow turn 
required to keep the Sun on the -x-axis triggered AACS fault protection. 
Most of the instrument checkout activities were rescheduled after a 10 day 
safing period. Those that were not completed were rescheduled for the ICO-2 
subphase during Outer Cruise.

     VENUS 2 - EARTH CRUISE      1999-03-15 to 1999-11-07
                                 1999-074   to 1999-311
     ----------------------

The Venus 2 - Earth Cruise subphase started on 15 March 1999, 45 days prior 
to the second Venus flyby, and continued through 7 November 1999, which was 
82 days after the Earth flyby. The subphase encompassed sequences C13 
through C16, and included seven scheduled TCMs, two planetary swingbys, and 
25 science activities in addition to normal engineering activities. Science 
activities included maintenance, calibration, checkout, and science 
observations using all of the Cassini instruments except INMS and CIRS.

         VENUS 2 ENCOUNTER    1999-06-24
                              1999-175

TCM-7 was executed 37 days before the Venus 2 Encounter. TCM-8 was 
scheduled 21 days prior to Venus 2, but it was canceled. DSN (Deep Space 
Network) coverage increased from one to three passes per day in support of 
the flyby. 

         EARTH ENCOUNTER      1999-08-18
                              1999-230

The Earth flyby occurred 55 days after the Venus 2 flyby. The spacecraft 
approached the Earth from approximately the direction of the Sun. Closest 
approach occurred right after the spacecraft entered the Sun occultation 
zone. The occultation lasted approximately 30 minutes. The altitude at 
closest approach was 1175 km, with an Earth-relative velocity of 19.0 km/s. 
Trajectory correction maneuvers took place 43, 30, 15 and 6.5 days before 
closest approach, and a clean-up maneuver was executed 13 days after the 
flyby. Continuous DSN coverage began at the Venus 2 flyby and continued 
through the Earth flyby. A week after the Earth Encounter, DSN coverage 
dropped to one pass every two days.

Five instruments conducted observations as Cassini passed through the 
Earth's magnetotail.

OUTER CRUISE  1999-11-08 to 2002-07-07
              1999-312   to 2002-188
------------

The Outer Cruise Phase consisted of four subphases: HGA Transition, 
Instrument Checkout 2, Jupiter Cruise, and Quiet Cruise. The Outer Cruise 
phase extended from 8 November 1999 (when the spacecraft reached a Sun 
range of 2.7 AU) to 7 July 2002 (about two years before Saturn Orbit 
Insertion). At 2.7 AU (1 February 2000), the HGA began continuous Earth-
pointing. The one planetary encounter in this phase was the flyby of 
Jupiter in December 2000. Science at Jupiter was an opportunity to test 
Saturn observation strategies with HGA data rates.

     HIGH GAIN ANTENNA TRANSITION  1999-11-08 to 2000-05-06
                                   1999-312   to 2000-127
     ----------------------------

This subphase included sequences C17 to C19, operation of ISS and VIMS 
decontamination heaters, CDA dust calibrations, and Magnetosphere and 
Plasma Science (MAPS) observations after the HGA was pointed toward Earth.

During the initial part of the subphase (C17 and part of C18), 
telecommunications were via LGA1, and the spacecraft was at the farthest 
distance from Earth before transitioning to the HGA for regular use. 
Therefore, data rates were very low and activities were kept to a minimum. 
C17 included standard maintenance and one Periodic Engineering Maintenance 
(PEM) activity. Activities during the LGA1 portion of C18 included a 
Periodic Instrument Maintenance (PIM); observations by ISS, VIMS, and UVIS 
of the asteroid Masursky near closest approach (1,634,000 km); and ISS dark 
frame calibration images directly following the Masursky observations.

The HGA was turned toward Earth for regular use on 1 February 2000, during 
C18. Several activities took place during the rest of C18, using the 
greater telemetry capabilities available with the HGA:  playback of the 
Masursky data and ISS dark frames, a Probe checkout, a Huygens Probe S-band 
Relay to Cassini Test, a Telemetry-Ranging Interference Test, MAG 
calibrations, and a PEM. Regular MAPS observations by CAPS, CDA, MAG, MIMI, 
and RPWS began within a few days after transitioning to the HGA.

The first 6 weeks of C19 were used for a checkout of new Flight Software. 
The AACS version A7 software was uploaded near the beginning of this 
period, and the first 2 weeks were devoted to AACS tests. The next 4 weeks 
were originally scheduled for CDS tests of version V7.0. However, these 
tests were delayed to late July and August of 2000 to allow time for 
additional regression testing. During the AACS checkout period, MAPS 
activity ceased. Several activities took place during the last 3 weeks of 
C19: resumption of MAPS observations, three RSS activities (HGA pattern 
calibration, HGA boresight calibration, and USO characterization), CIRS 
Cooler Cover release, and a PIM.

A few days before the end of C19, the command loss timer setting was 
increased slightly, to account for the 10-day period at the beginning of 
C20 during which superior conjunction made commanding problematic.

     INSTRUMENT CHECKOUT 2   2000-05-06 to 2000-11-05
                             2000-127   to 2000-310
     ---------------------

The second instrument checkout subphase (ICO-2) was scheduled from 6 May 
2000 to 5 November of 2000, after the Spacecraft Office had completed its 
engineering checkout activities. ICO-2 included instrument checkout that 
required reaction wheel stability and any instrument checkouts that were 
not successfully completed during ICO-1. But the CDS Flight Software V7 
uplink and checkout, which was delayed from March, was rescheduled to late 
July through early September 2000, causing many ICO-2 activities to be 
compressed into a shorter and more intense period. Some activities were 
postponed until after the Jupiter observations were completed in 2001. 

The subphase began with a superior conjunction which precluded early 
science or engineering activities. MAPS instruments remained on; but data 
return was not attempted during conjunction. Two TCMs were scheduled for 
Jupiter targeting, in June and September.

Engineering activities included the continuous use of reaction wheels and, 
beginning on 1 October 2000, dual Solid State Recorders (SSRs). There were 
no scheduled instrument PIMs during ICO-2 since all instruments had other 
activities that accomplished this function. Other engineering activities 
included two Reaction Wheel Assembly (RWA) friction tests, two PEMs, and an 
SRU calibration.

Science activities began with the MAPS instruments continuing from C19. New 
flight software was loaded for eight instruments in late May, and a CDA 
software update was done in September. New Quiet Tests, while operating on 
reaction wheels, were done in July for most instruments. RSS Quiet Tests 
were done in September, and RADAR related tests were done in late June. A 
Probe checkout occurred in late July. 

Spacecraft turns were done for RADAR observations of the Sun and Jupiter in 
June and again in September. The star Alpha Piscis Austrinus (Fomalhaut) 
was also observed in September by VIMS with ISS and UVIS doing ride-along 
science. No other science turns were scheduled until October. On 1 October, 
science began using a repeating 5-day template to gather Jupiter science. 
This involved 11 turns in a 5 day period, including two downlinks. The 
turns in the 5-day template involved 4 orientations: 

     Orbiter Remote Science (ORS) boresights to Jupiter,
       Z axis parallel to ecliptic
     HGA to Sun, rolling about Z axis
     Probe to Sun, rotating about X axis
     HGA to Earth, Probe offset from Sun for CDA, not
        rotating, downlink orientation

     JUPITER CRUISE          2000-11-05 to 2001-04-30
                             2000-310   to 2001-120
     --------------

The Jupiter Cruise subphase extended from 6 November 2000 to 29 April 2001 
and included sequences C23 to C25. However Jupiter remote sensing 
observations actually began on 1 October 2000, in C22.

         JUPITER ENCOUNTER   2000-12-30
                             2000-365

The Jupiter flyby occurred on 30 December 2000 at an altitude of 9.7 
million km. This gravity assist rotated the trajectory 12 deg and increased 
the heliocentric velocity by 2 km/s. The Jupiter relative speed at closest 
approach was 11.6 km/s. At closest approach, Jupiter filled the Narrow 
Angle Camera (NAC) field of view. Extensive Jupiter science was performed 
which required additional DSN support: up to two passes every five days, 
and a maximum of one pass every 30 hours in the 10 days on either side of 
closest approach. Science at Jupiter was an opportunity to test how to 
build and execute viable Saturn sequences. 

A problem with the RWAs occurred on 16 December 2000. Increased friction on 
one of the wheels caused the spacecraft to switch autonomously to the 
Reaction Control Subsystem (RCS) for attitude control. With the switch to 
RCS, hydrazine usage increased. Two of four joint CAPS-Hubble Space 
Telescope observations, a Jupiter North-South map, the Himalia 'flyby', and 
a UVIS torus observation were all executed on RCS before the sequence was 
terminated on 19 December 2000. MAPS data continued to be recorded at a 
reduced rate. All other planned science activities were suspended.  After 
tests, RWA operation was resumed for attitude control on 22 December, with 
the wheels biased away from low RPM regions.  The sequence was restarted on 
29 December.

     QUIET CRUISE            2001-04-30 to 2002-07-08
                             2001-120   to 2002-189
     ------------

Quiet Cruise was a 14 month subphase that started at the end of Jupiter 
Cruise and ended two years before SOI. During this subphase, routine 
maintenance, engineering, and navigation functions were carried out. One 
Gravitational Wave Experiment (GWE) was conducted in December 2001, and one 
Solar Conjunction Experiment (SCE) was conducted in June 2002. 

SCIENCE CRUISE 2002-07-08 to 2004-06-10
               2002-189   to 2004-162
--------------

     SPACE SCIENCE     2002-07-08 to 2004-01-11
                       2002-189   to 2004-011

The Space Science subphase began on 8 July 2002 and ran through 11 January 
2004. TCMs 18 and 19, two GWEs (December 2002 and December 2003) and one 
SCE (June-July 2003) were conducted.

     APPROACH SCIENCE  2004-01-12 to 2004-06-10
                       2004-012   to 2004-162

The Approach Science subphase began six months before SOI and ended three 
weeks before SOI, when the spacecraft was approaching Saturn at a rate of 5 
kilometers per second. Most of the activities during the Approach Science 
subphase were Saturn science observations and preparation for the Phoebe 
flyby, SOI, and Tour operations. 

The reaction wheels were turned on at the beginning of the subphase to 
provide a more stable viewing platform. By this point, the imaging 
instruments had begun atmospheric imaging, and making long-term atmospheric 
movies. CIRS began long integrations of Saturn's disk. At SOI - 4 months, 
Saturn filled one third of the NAC field of view and one half of the CIRS 
Far Infrared (FIR) field of view.  

The Saturn approach was made toward the morning terminator at a phase angle 
of about 75 degrees; VIMS gathered data on the temperature difference 
across the terminator. UVIS scans of the Saturn System began 3-4 months 
before SOI. Fields, particles, and waves instruments collected solar wind 
information and recorded Saturn emissions as the spacecraft neared the 
planet. Science data gathered during this period was stored on the SSR and 
transmitted back to Earth. Daily DSN tracking coverage began 90 days before 
SOI.

The Phoebe approach TCM took place on 27 May 2004, 15 days before Phoebe 
closest approach.


TOUR PRE-HUYGENS  2004-06-11 to 2004-12-24
                  2004-163   to 2004-359
----------------

The Tour Pre-Huygens Phase extended from the Phoebe Encounter through 
Saturn Orbit Insertion to separation of the Huygens Probe from the Cassini 
Orbiter.

     PHOEBE ENCOUNTER         2004-06-11
                              2004-163

The flyby of Phoebe occurred on 11 June 2004, 19 days before SOI.  At 
closest approach (19:33 UTC) the spacecraft was 2000 km above the surface.

     SATURN ORBIT INSERTION   2004-07-01
                              2004-183

During Saturn Orbit Insertion (SOI) on 1 July 2004, the spacecraft made its 
closest approach to the planet's surface during the entire mission at an 
altitude of only 0.3 Saturn radii (18,000 km).  Due to this unique 
opportunity, the approximately 95-minute SOI burn (633 m/s total delta-V), 
required to place Cassini in orbit around Saturn, was executed earlier than 
its optimal point centered around periapsis, and instead ended near 
periapsis, allowing science observations immediately after burn completion. 
The SOI maneuver placed the spacecraft in an initial orbit with a periapsis 
radius of 1.3 Rs, a period of 148 days, and an inclination of 16.8 degrees. 

After the burn, the spacecraft was turned to allow the ORS instruments to 
view the Saturn inner rings that were not in shadow. After periapsis, the 
trajectory just grazed the occultation zones behind the planet with the 
Earth and Sun being occulted by Saturn.  After communication with Earth was 
re-established, the spacecraft remained on Earth pointed for nine hours to 
play back engineering and science data and to give ground personnel time to 
evaluate the spacecraft status. 

After SOI a pair of cleanup maneuvers was used to correct for errors in the 
SOI burn. The first was immediately before superior conjunction, at SOI + 3 
days, and the second was after conjunction at SOI + 16 days. 

Probe checkouts were scheduled at SOI + 14 days, Probe Release Maneuver 
(PRM) + 4 days, and ten days before separation. 

The partial orbit between SOI and the first apoapsis was designated orbit 
0.  The next three orbits were designated a, b, and c.

     HUYGENS PROBE SEPARATION 2004-12-24
                              2004-359

The probe was released from the Orbiter on 24 December 2004, 11 days after 
the second Titan flyby (orbit b).  Two days after the Probe was released, 
the Orbiter executed a deflection maneuver to place itself on the proper 
trajectory for the third encounter. 


     TITAN C HUYGENS          2005-01-14
                              2005-014

During the third flyby (orbit c), on 14 January 2005, the Huygens Probe 
transmitted data to the orbiter for approximately 150 minutes during its 
descent through the atmosphere to the surface.

Because the Orbiter was looking at Titan through most of the corresponding 
Goldstone tracking pass, DSN support on this day was primarily through the 
70-meter antennas at the Canberra and Madrid tracking complexes. While 
approaching Titan, the Orbiter made its last downlink transmission (to the 
Madrid station, DSS 63) before switching to Probe relay mode. The Orbiter 
then turned nearly 180 degrees to point its HGA at the predicted Probe 
impact point, and the Probe Support Avionics (PSA) were configured to 
receive data from the Probe. Some Orbiter instruments were put into a low 
power state to provide additional power for the PSA. The data from the 
Probe were transmitted at S band in two separate data streams, and both 
were recorded on each SSR. Following completion of the predicted descent 
(maximum 150 minutes), the Orbiter listened for Probe signals for an 
additional 30 minutes, in case they continued after landing. 

When data collection from the Probe was completed, those data were write 
protected on each SSR. The spacecraft then turned to view Titan with 
optical remote sensing instruments until about one hour after closest 
approach for a total observing window of TBD.

The Orbiter then turned the HGA towards Earth and began transmitting the 
recorded Probe data to the Canberra 70-m antenna. The complete, four-fold 
redundant set of Probe data was transmitted twice, and its receipt 
verified, before the write protection on that portion of the SSR was lifted 
by ground command. A second playback, including all of the Probe data and 
the Orbiter instrument observations, was returned over the subsequent 
Madrid 70-meter tracking pass, which was longer and at higher elevation 
angles.

TOUR   2005-01-14 to 2008-06-30
       2005-014   to 2008-182
----

The Tour Phase of the mission began at completion of the Huygens Probe and 
Orbiter-support playback and ended on 30 June 2008.  It included dozens of 
satellite encounters and extended observations of Saturn, its rings, and 
its environment of particles and fields.

     TOUR SEQUENCE BOUNDARIES

The table below shows spacecraft background sequences, orbit revolution, 
start epoch (including day-of-year in a separate column), and the length of 
the sequence.  For completeness, all 'S' sequences are listed even though 
the first seven covered times before the Tour phase.  Each orbit about 
Saturn was assigned a revolution identifier starting with a, b, and c, and 
then numerically ascending from 3 to 74; these were not synchronous with 
sequences, some of which covered only partial orbits.  Full orbits began 
and ended at apoapsis; the partial orbit from SOI to the first apoapsis was 
orbit 0.

     SATELLITE ENCOUNTER SUMMARY

This table summarizes the Cassini Orbiter satellite encounters; for 
completeness, all recognized encounters are included even though the first 
eight preceded the Tour phase.  Rev identifies the orbit revolution as 
defined above.  The three character ID for the encounter is in the second 
column; an appended asterisk (*) denotes a non-targeted encounter.  The 
target, date and time, and day-of-year are in the next three columns. 
Altitude above the surface at closest approach, sense of the encounter 
(whether on the inbound or outbound leg of an orbit), relative velocity at 
closest approach, and phase angle at closest approach round out the 
columns.

    CASSINI-HUYGENS MISSION OBJECTIVES
    ==================================

The Cassini-Huygens mission will accomplish a variety of scientific 
objectives en route to and at Saturn [JPLD-5564]. 

While en route to Saturn, Cassini performed three sets of Gravitational 
Wave Experiments (GWEs), each scheduled near opposition and each lasting 
approximately 40 days.  During these observations, Cassini acted as a point 
mass which would be perturbed by propagating gravitational waves resulting 
from sudden destruction (or creation) of large masses in the general 
direction of the spacecraft-to-Earth line.

While en route to Saturn, Cassini was also used in two Solar Conjunction 
Experiments (SCEs), each lasting approximately 30 days.  The objectives of 
these observations was to test general relativity and to improve our 
understanding of the solar corona.

The general scientific objectives of the Cassini mission at Saturn were to 
investigate the physical, chemical, and temporal characteristics of Titan 
and of Saturn, its atmosphere, rings, icy satellites, and magnetosphere. 
These are listed more specifically below:

Saturn (Planet) Objectives.
--------------------------

a) Determine temperature field, cloud properties, and composition of the 
atmosphere of Saturn.

b) Measure the global wind field, including wave and eddy components; 
observe synoptic cloud features and processes.

c) Infer the internal structure and rotation of the deep atmosphere.

d) Study the diurnal variations and magnetic control of the ionosphere of 
Saturn.

e) Provide observational constraints (gas composition, isotope ratios, heat 
flux, etc.) on scenarios for the formation and the evolution of Saturn.

f) Investigate the sources and the morphology of Saturn lightning, Saturn 
Electrostatic Discharges (SED), and whistlers.


Titan Objectives.
---------------- 

a) Determine abundance of atmospheric constituents (including any noble 
gases), establish isotope ratios for abundant elements, constrain scenarios 
of formation and evolution of Titan and its atmosphere.

b) Observe vertical and horizontal distributions of trace gases, search for 
more complex organic molecules, investigate energy sources for atmospheric 
chemistry, and model the photochemistry of the stratosphere, study 
formation and composition of aerosols.

c) Measure winds and global temperatures; investigate cloud physics, 
general circulation, and seasonal effects in Titan's atmosphere; search for 
lightning discharges.

d) Determine the physical state, topography, and composition of the 
surface; infer the internal structure of the satellite.

e) Investigate the upper atmosphere, its ionization, and its role as a 
source of neutral and ionized material for magnetosphere of Saturn.


Ring Objectives. 
---------------

a) Study configuration of the rings and dynamical processes (gravitational, 
viscous, erosional, and electromagnetic) responsible for ring structure.

b) Map composition and size distribution of ring material.

c) Investigate interrelation of rings and satellites, including embedded 
satellites.

d) Determine dust and meteoroid distribution in the vicinity of the rings.

e) Study interactions between the rings and Saturn's magnetosphere, 
ionosphere, and atmosphere.


Icy Satellite Objectives.
------------------------

a) Determine the general characteristics and geological histories of the 
satellites.

b) Define the mechanisms of crustal and surface modifications, both 
external and internal.

c) Investigate the compositions and distributions of surface materials, 
particularly dark, organic rich materials and low melting point condensed 
volatiles.

d) Constrain models of the satellites' bulk compositions and internal 
structures.

e) Investigate interactions with the magnetosphere and ring systems and 
possible gas injections into the magnetosphere.


Magnetosphere Objectives
------------------------

a) Determine the configuration of the nearly axially symmetric magnetic 
field and its relation to the modulation of Saturn Kilometric Radiation 
(SKR).

b) Determine current systems, composition, sources, and sinks of 
magnetosphere charged particles.

c) Investigate wave-particle interactions and dynamics of the dayside 
magnetosphere and the magnetotail of Saturn and their interactions with the 
solar wind, the satellites, and the rings.

d) Study the effect of Titan's interaction with the solar wind and 
magnetospheric plasma.

e) Investigate interactions of Titan's atmosphere and exosphere with the 
surrounding plasma.   "

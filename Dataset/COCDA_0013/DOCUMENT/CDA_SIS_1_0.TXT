1.	INTRODUCTION

1.1.	Purpose and Scope

This document describes the format and the content of the CDA products as archived in the 
Small Bodies Node in the PDS. The data products stored in the PDS are a subset of the holdings 
of the CDA team database in Heidelberg.

This SIS is intended to provide enough information to enable users to read and understand the 
CDA data products as stored in the PDS. The users for whom this SIS is intended are software 
developers of the programs used in generating the CDA products and scientists who will analyze 
the data, including those associated with the Cassini-Huygens Project and those in the general 
planetary science community. 

1.2.	Contents

The Cosmic Dust Analyser (CDA) is an instrument on the Cassini orbiter that studies the 
physical properties of dust particles hitting the detector. This Data Product SIS describes how the 
CDA instrument acquires its data, and how the data are processed. This document specifically 
discusses the high level data subset, which is stored in the PDS.

1.3.	Applicable Documents and Constraints

This Data Product SIS is responsive to the following Cassini documents:

1	Cassini/Huygens Program Archive Plan for Science Data, PD 699-068.

The reader is referred to the following documents for additional information:

2.	DATA PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS

2.1.	Instrument Overview

The Cosmic Dust Analyser instrument (CDA) on the Cassini orbiter is the successor of the dust 
detectors flown on the Ulysses and the Galileo spacecrafts. The instrument accomplishes the 
detection of dust impacts by two different means: (1) a high rate detector (HRD), using two 
separate polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) sensors, and (2) a Dust Analyser (DA) based upon 
impact ionization. The DA measures the electric charges carried by the dust particle, the impact 
direction, the impact speed, mass, and the chemical composition, whereas the HRD is only 
capable to determine the mass for particles with a known speed. Note that the data product for 
the HRD subsystem will not be described here, but in a separate SIS document.
The DA detector consists of three components: the charge detection unit, the impact ionization 
detector itself, and the time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer.

2.1.1.	Charge Detection Unit 

The charge detection unit (CDU) consists of 4 entrance grids mounted in front of the ionization 
detector. The outermost and innermost grids are grounded, while the two innermost inclined 
grids are connected with a charge amplifier (QP charge signal). A charged particle flying through 
the entrance grid system induces its charge onto the innermost grids. The inclined grid mounting 
leads to asymmetric signal shapes which allows the determination of the particle direction as 
well as the particle speed within a plane.

2.1.2.	Impact Ionization Detector

The impact ionization detector consists of a hemispherical impact target (small inner target made 
of Rhodium – chemical analyser target (CAT); large outer target made of Gold – impact 
ionization target (IID)), and the ion collector grid system. The plasma constituents generated by 
the dust impact onto the impact target are separated by the electric field between the target and 
the ion grid. The plasma electrons are collected at the CAT (QC charge signal) and the IID (QT 
charge signal), while most of the positive plasma ions are collected at the ion collector grid 
system (QI charge signal). Ions escaping the impact ionization detector are inducing their 
charges onto the charge detection grids (QP charge signal). The particle mass and the impact 
speed is deduced from the evolution of the impact plasma: the charge yield of the impact plasma 
is a function of the impactor's mass and velocity, while the plasma charge rise time is dependent 
on the impact speed only.

2.1.3.	TOF mass spectrometer

The TOF mass spectrometer consists of the chemical analyser target (CAT), chemical analyser 
grid located 3 mm in front of the CAT, and the multiplier dynodes connected with the Dynode 
Logarithmic Amplifier (MP signal). Due to the strong electric field between the grid and the 
CAT, positive plasma ions are separated very quickly from the plasma and accelerated toward 
the multiplier, forming a time-of-flight mass spectrum.    

2.2.	Data Products

2.2.1.	Overview

2.2.2.	Data Product Detailed Description and Format

See Appendix 1 for provisional PDS labels.
See Appendix 2 for condensed column descriptions (derived from the PDS labels).

2.2.3.	Data Products Generation
All data products and associated documentation will be generated by the CDA team. The PDS 
SBN will assist in the definition and development of first delivery products and their associated 
PDS documentation, which will act as templates for subsequent updates. When new products are 
developed by the CDA team, PDS SBN will likewise assist in the definition and development of 
those products and their associated PDS documentation in preparation for their initial delivery. 

2.3.	Calibration Issues

2.3.1.	Calibration of the Impact Ionization Detector
The calibration principle of the impact ionization detector is similar to the Galileo and Ulysses 
instrument. The calibration of the velocity-dependence of the signal rise times as well as the 
calibration of the mass-velocity-dependence of the plasma charge yields is based upon impact 
experiments in ground based laboratory accelerators. In such facilities, impacts of particles with 
known mass and velocity onto the flight spare unit can be studied. As the interference of the 
inner target (CAT) with the outer target (IID) is not entirely understood, future calibration work 
will be focused on this issue. Besides laboratory experiments, in-flight measurements in the well-
understood environment at 1 AU as well as measurements of Jovian stream particles contributed 
to the instrument calibration. Data obtained after SOI will also contribute to a better 
understanding of the instrument response. Therefore, a definitive calibration will be available 
only late in the mission.
2.3.2.	Calibration of the Mass Analyser
The calibration of the TOF mass spectrometer is still preliminary. In order to determine the mass 
resolution as well as the instrument characteristics, particles of known composition were shot in 
the Heidelberg dust accelerator onto the flight spare unit. The same remarks as for the IID 
subsystem do apply.

2.4.	Data Processing
2.4.1.	Data Processing Level
This documentation uses the "Committee on Data Management and Computation" (CODMAC) 
data level numbering system.  The data files referred to in this document are considered "level 2" 
or "Edited Data" (equivalent to NASA level 0).  The data files are generated from level 1 or 
"Raw Data" which is the telemetry packets within the project specific Standard Formatted Data 
Unit (SFDU) record.  Refer to Table 1.

Table 1.  Processing Levels for Science Data Sets
NASA
CODMAC
Description
Packet data
Raw - Level 1
Telemetry data stream as received at the ground station, with science and engineering data embedded.
Level-0
Edited - Level 2
Instrument science data (e.g., raw voltages, counts) at full resolution, time ordered, with duplicates and transmission 
errors removed.
Level 1-A
Calibrated - Level 3
Level 0 data that have been located in space and may have been transformed (e.g., calibrated, rearranged) in a 
reversible manner and packaged with needed ancillary and auxiliary data (e.g., radiances with the calibration 
equations applied).
Level 1-B
Resampled - Level 4
Irreversibly transformed (e.g., resampled, remapped, calibrated) values of the instrument measurements (e.g., 
radiances, magnetic field strength).
Level 1-C
Derived - Level 5
Level 1A or 1B data that have been resampled and mapped onto uniform space-time grids. The data are calibrated 
(i.e., radiometrically corrected) and may have additional corrections applied (e.g., terrain correction).
Level 2
Derived - Level 5
Geophysical parameters, generally derived from Level 1 data, and located in space and time commensurate with 
instrument location, pointing, and sampling.
Level 3
Derived - Level 5
Geophysical parameters mapped onto uniform space-time grids.

2.4.2.	Data Product Generation
The CDA data products will be generated by the CDA team at the MPI-K in Heidelberg using 
the CDA data decoding and calibration software. The CDA event raw data (NASA level 0) will 
be reconstructed from the telemetry packets (SFDU) delivered by JPL and decoded according to 
the "CDA FSW users' guide" by the CDA decoding software. The CDA raw data together with 
meta-data extracted from the telemetry headers and SPICE data products will be deposited in the 
CDA data base in Heidelberg. Multiple event data will be removed from the stored data set. The 
higher data products will be exclusively derived from the uncalibrated raw data stored in the 
Heidelberg data base by means of the CDA calibration software. 
 
3.	ARCHIVE VOLUMES

3.1.	Generation

The CDA Data Product Archive Collection and its updates are produced by the CDA Instrument 
Team in cooperation with the Small Bodies Node (SBN) of the PDS. It consists of a set of DVDs 
containing the CDA data set. The DVDs may be generated by SBN when the CDA team 
generates and transfers to SBN the DVDs images. The Archive Collection will include data 
acquired during the Cruise phase as well as during the Tour.

The SBN and the CDA will collaborate to design the PDS documentation (label, catalog, and 
index) files associated with the initial data delivery by the CDA team. SBN and the CDA team 
together will also identify how these files are to be updated in subsequent deliveries. This 
procedure will also be followed with new data products as they become available.  The CDA 
team will include these documentation files (and subsequent updates) with their deliveries. All 
data formats are based on the Planetary Data System standards as documented in the PDS 
Standards Reference. 


3.2.	Data Transfer 

The archive volumes are produced and transferred to PDS per schedule agreed upon between the 
CDA team and SBN and within the schedule defined in the Cassini-Huygens Archive Plan for 
Science Data. When sufficient data for a new archive volume are ready for validation, according 
to the mutually agreed upon schedule, the CDA team will deliver the data stored on DVDs to the 
SBN of the PDS.  Delivery may also be electronic, in which case directory file structures of the 
DVDs will be reflected.

3.3.	Review and Revision

The archive validation procedure described in this section applies to volumes generated during 
all phases of the mission.  All data archived by the PDS are validated by use of the PDS peer 
review procedures.  

The data and documentation will be subject to PDS internal review followed by an external peer 
review. The external review consists of at least two scientists having interest in the products 
being generated by the CDA who are associated with neither the CDA team nor the PDS. 
Reviewers are selected by the PDS with input from the CDA team.

In the event that the contents of a volume are found to contain errors, the reviewers can 
recommend one of two courses of action: fix the files or publish as is with a note in the 
ERRATA.TXT file.  If the errors are minor, typically minor errors in the documentation, the 
volume can be published if the appropriate notes added to the volume's errata file and the 
error(s) are corrected on subsequent volumes.  If the errors are major, typically involving errors 
in the data themselves, the corrections constitute liens against the data set that must be resolved 
before the data set can be ingested by the PDS. In that event, the volume must be corrected, re-
generated by the CDA team, and sent back out for review.

After peer review and lien resolution, 6 DVD copies of each finalized volume are produced by 
PDS SBN. Two copies are sent back to the CDA team (Heidelberg and Chicago). Of the 
remaining four copies, two remain at SBN for online access and backup, one is delivered to PDS 
CN, and the other is delivered to NSSDC for deep archiving. For accounting purposes, this will 
be considered a mission cost assumed by the PDS SBN.
3.4.	Data Volume Architecture
The volume name is COCDA_NNNN, where NNNN is the volume number. 
Data will be delivered to SBN on DVD or DVD-image with the following directory architecture:









COCDA_NNNN ----------AAREADME.TXT , VOLDESC.CAT, ERRATA.TXT
                    	|
                    	|--/DATA         [this directory contains all data products and their labels.]
		    	|
                    	|--/CATALOG [this directory contains the data set, instrument, 
			|                          and mission catalog files.]
			|
                    	|--/INDEX [this directory contains the index files for the volume.]
			|
                        |--/DOCUMENT [this directory contains the document you are reading.] 

There will be a separate document volume containing appropriate documents on instrument 
operation and calibration when they are available.
The CDA data production rate depends upon the dust impact rate and on the spacecraft telemetry 
rate. Assuming an average number impact rate of about 2000 events per week (during cruise 
phase) leads to a predicted data production rate of 8 MB per week . So one DVD-worth of data is 
produced for every year from the beginning of the Cruise measurements in 1999.  The time 
required to process the data and validate the products is approximately one (1) year. Data 
volumes are expected to be much higher while in Saturn orbit.

3.5	Interface Media Characteristics

All volumes in the CDA PDS Product Archive Collection will be CD-ROMs.  If the archive 
media changes from CD-ROM to DVD, there will be no changes to the file naming or other 
conventions.

3.6	      Backup and Duplicates

SBN keeps two copies of each CD-R volume.  One volume is placed in the jukebox at SBN in 
order to make the data web accessible.  The second copy is a backup that can be used if the CD-
R sent to the vendor becomes lost or damaged.  One copy is sent to PDS CN. The two CD-R 
volumes sent to the CDA Team and the volume sent to NSSDC do not need to be returned to the 
SBN. 


3.7	 Labeling and Identification
Each CDA PDS CD-ROM bears a volume ID using the last two components of the volume set 
ID [PDS Standards Reference, 1995].

is reconstructed and converted to Coulomb. 
The rise time is that time elapsed between 
10% and 90% of the signal maximum. The 
error on the rise time is set by the channel 
sampling rate and is of 166.6E-9 s. In case of 
a noise event, or if the signal amplitude is 
zero, the rise time is set to its missing value.

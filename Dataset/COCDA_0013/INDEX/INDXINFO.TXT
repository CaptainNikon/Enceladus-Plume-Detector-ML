CUMINDEX.TAB   - This file contains one record for each data file on all      
CDA DVD published so far.                                                     
                                                                              
The INDEX.TAB and CUMINDEX.TAB are formatted so that they may be read         
directly into many database management systems on various computers. All      
fields are enclosed in double quotation marks ("). Each record contains       
105 bytes of ASCII character data (1 character = 1 byte). Bytes 104 and       
105 contain the ASCII carriage return and line feed characters. This          
allows the table to be treated as a fixed length record file on               
computers that support this file type and as a normal text file on other      
computers.

These notes describe the content of the DATA subdirectory. Please refer       
to the AAREADME.TXT file for an overview of the data files organization       
on this volume. For each data product table (.TAB files) a detached           
label table (.LBL files) describes the data table content. The .LBL file      
describes the content of the data in the corresponding .TAB file. In          
addition, all individual impact charge signals monitored by CDA during        
the time period covered by this volume are provided (directories              
QI_SIGNALS, QT_SIGNALS, QC_SIGNALS, QP_SIGNALS and MP_SIGNALS). One           
product table and one label table are associated to each charge signal.

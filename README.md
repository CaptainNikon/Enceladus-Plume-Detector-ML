# Enceladus Plume Detection with Cassini CDA Data

This repository contains analysis scripts and example notebooks used for
detecting and characterizing dust impacts in the Enceladus plume using data
from the **Cassini Cosmic Dust Analyzer (CDA)** instrument.

## Data Source

The CDA data used in this project are publicly available from NASA’s
**Planetary Data System (PDS)**.  
Specifically, the Cassini CDA calibrated and event data sets were obtained from:

> NASA Planetary Data System (PDS), Cassini Cosmic Dust Analyzer (CDA)  
> [[[https://pds-atmospheres.nmsu.edu/data_and_services/atmospheres_data/Cassini_PDS3/cda.html](https://sbn.psi.edu/pds/resource/cocda.html)](https://sbn.psi.edu/pds/resource/cocda.html)]([https://pds-atmospheres.nmsu.edu/data_and_services/atmospheres_data/Cassini_PDS3/cda.html](https://sbn.psi.edu/pds/resource/cocda.html))
